# Tower-Defence
## About
Tower-Defence is a simulation of a tower defence game where software bugs are trying to reach the top floor of a building. To fend these bugs off are students who defend the building and attack the bugs, damaging the bug in front. The goal of the simulation is to defeat all the bugs before the building collapses.

## How To Play
The bugs descriptions are read from a text file and then generated. The students are generated by a AI to defend against the bugs. 

## Features
- Sophisticated AI that creates students depending on what is needed at the time
- Save/Load system, meaning the state of the simulation can be saved at any time and subsequently loaded
- Several variations of bugs and students, each serving their own niche roles
